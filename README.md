# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This is a project from the ALXSE program meant to
. Test our understanding of various Python concepts including but not limited to Object Modelling, Object persistence, Test Driven Development (TDD) etc
. Develop the first part of our AirBnB clone using the concepts we've been exposed to
. Create a command intepreter that we can use to interact with our models and also save them as the case may be, this is to test the various functionalities we will be implementing before integrating the databases and the API

## How the Command Intepreter works

The command intepreter has three modes just like the shell project
### The interactive mode
You get into the interactive mode by executing the program which will display a promt
this prompt keeps taking your commands until you quit it e.g
$ ./console		# This is you invoking the program in your shell app
(hbnb) |		# A prompt is displayed waiting for your input
(hbnb) help
